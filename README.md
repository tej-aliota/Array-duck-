My Ducks name is: Piggy (Cause it looks like a minecraft pig :-) )


Duck decoding is a method to debug your code by saying it and explaining it outloud to an object (duck). The reason this is helpful is because
it allows your mind to slow down and go back through all the details which usually helps you pin point the little error. Ducks are cool becaues they are
easier to talk to the humans and are also always available when ever you have an issue.
